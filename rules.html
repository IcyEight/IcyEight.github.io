		<h4> Checkers Overview </h4>
		<p>Checkers is a game played on a 8x8 board with each player given 12 pieces of a single color.  Traditionally known as a board game, this version of checkers is transformed into an online game that can be played by two players anytime.</p>
		</br>
		<h4> Rules </h4>
		<ul>
			<li> Red checkers will always go first. </li>
			<li> On a single turn, a checker piece may only be moved diagonally one space, with the exception of jumping. </li>
			<li> A checker piece may be moved more than one space if it is able to jump an opponent's piece.  A valid jump is when an opponent's piece is diagonal from the player's piece and that player is able to move his/ her piece over the opponent's piece and onto a blank tile.  This movement must also be on a single diagonal. </li>
			<li> Multiple jumps can be performed on a single turn. </li>
		</ul>
		</br>
		<h4> Strategy </h4>
		<ul>
			<li> Always diagonally double up your checkers so that they cannot be jumped. </li>
			<li> Get your checkers kinged as soon as possible.  This will allow them to move freely around the board. </li>
		</ul>
